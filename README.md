# MyAndroidApp

My first attempt at developing a practice Android application. This is a base version, and I plan on adding more features to it in the future.

All files here were extracted from my "AndroidAppProject" base project file > app > src, as uploading all Gradle/Build files was not necessary. The app was built from a "DrawerLayout" base selected upon setting up the new project.
